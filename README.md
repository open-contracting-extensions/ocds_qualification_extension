# Qualification

This extension should only be used as part of the [OCDS for PPPs profile](http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/). It adds a `preQualification` section between `planning` and `tender`; this second initiation stage is incompatible with the OCDS 1.x definition of a contracting process.

## Example

```json
